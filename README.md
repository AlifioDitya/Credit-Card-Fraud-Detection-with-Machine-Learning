# Random Forest Machine Learning Model on Credit Card Fraud Detection
by Enrique Alifio Ditya

## Abstract
In this paper, I explore the use of the random forest 
machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card 
transactions. I first provide a brief overview of the concepts needed 
to understand the random forest algorithm. I then describe how a 
random forest model can be trained on historical data to identify 
patterns in the data that are associated with fraudulent transactions. 
Finally, I present Python code that demonstrates implementation of 
the random forest model to make predictions on fraudulent 
transactions and evaluating its performance in comparison to a 
single decision tree model.
